# calculator
TOP project

Working calculator, some things that could be improved:

- Adding commas on integers larger than 10,000 to help it be more readable

- The decimal places shortening to 5 places sometimes just adds a bunch of zeros. Must be a math.floor phenomenon.. remove them if they show up?

- Add in keyboard support
